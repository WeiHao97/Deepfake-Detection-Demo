# AI Detection Demo Page

This repository hosts the AI Detection Demo Page, designed to showcase the capabilities of the "Raidar" system developed by Columbia Researchers. This interactive web demo focuses on distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated texts, including code, highlighting potential applications and ethical considerations.

## Overview

The AI Detection Demo Page provides an interactive interface for demonstrating the research conducted on AI-generated text detection. It features two main demonstrations: voice detection and text detection, which help users understand the technology's ability to discern human from machine-generated content.

## Features

- **Research Overview**: Introduces the Raidar system, its purpose, and the underlying challenges with LLMs (Large Language Models).
- **Interactive Demos**:
  - **Voice Detection**: Demonstrates the detection of AI-generated voices.
  - **Text Detection**: Focuses on identifying AI-generated text and code.
- **Ethical Disclosure**: Details the ethical use and the intended academic purpose of the Raidar system.
- **Contact Form**: Allows users to reach out for further information or to engage with the research team directly.
